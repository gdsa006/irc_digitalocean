<h4>About our Roofing Company processing procedures</h4>
<p>We use several criteria as part of our enrollment and profiling process for service professionals available through our site.</p>

<p>Roofing Company Profiles: We allow roofing companies to post profiles about themselves and their business. We do not certify nor verify the information or representations set forth in those profiles. Profiles are self-reported by the Service Professional.</p>

<p>"Pre-Screened" Accreditation: To gain the "Pre-Screened" accreditation, a roofing company must first certify that they meet certain criteria, including but not limited to licensing, financial status, legal status, experience, and customer references, as reported by them on their application to us. We attempt to keep information current on an annual basis by reminding service professionals to update and re-certify their account information. This is a "self-certification" process. Service professional information may be entered incorrectly, may change or may expire over time; while we attempt to maintain accurate and up-to-date information, and confirm changes when notified, we cannot guarantee that profile and screening information is accurate. Therefore, we recommend that before working with a service professional you verify that information presented is correct, current and/or acceptable to you. For your convenience, we try to provide links where you can verify certain information yourself.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: ROOFING CALCULATOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED RELATING TO THE PRESCREENING PROCESS, CRITERIA, PROCEDURES, OR INFORMATION OBTAINED OR PRESENTED IN THE PRESCREENING PROCESS OR DISCLOSURES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, OR THAT THE SCREENING OR VERIFICATION PROCEDURES OR STANDARDS ARE SUFFICIENT OR THAT THE INFORMATION RECEIVED IN THESE SCREENING OR VERIFICATION PROCEDURES IS ACCURATE, TIMELY OR ERROR FREE.</p>

<p>Customer Surveys (Ratings & Reviews): We ask roofing companies to provide references (email addresses and names) of past customers. We then email requests to those customers asking them to complete a survey of the work performed for them by the referring service professional. Persons may also enter survey information without having been referred by a roofing companies. We do not "police" this survey system; checks are made by us to help insure the survey system is not being manipulated or receiving false or inaccurate information. For example, we check to see if a survey response comes from the same email address more than once.</p>

<p>We reserve the right, but not the obligation, to refuse to post or to remove any Review, or remove or modify any portion thereof, if we determine (at our sole discretion) that it contains or features any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offensive, harmful and/or abusive language, including without limitation: expletives, profanities, obscenities, harassment, vulgarities, sexually explicit language and hate speech (e.g., racist/discriminatory speech).</li>
<li>Reviews 'red flagged' (e.g. added by a company).</li>
<li>References to illegal activity.</li>
